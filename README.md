# CS 6515: Intro to Graduate Algorithms

This course is a graduate-level course in the design and analysis of algorithms. We study techniques for the design of algorithms (such as dynamic programming) and algorithms for fundamental problems (such as fast Fourier transform FFT). In addition, we study computational intractability, specifically, the theory of NP-completeness. The main topics covered in the course include: dynamic programming; divide and conquer, including FFT; randomized algorithms, including RSA cryptosystem;  graph algorithms; max-flow algorithms; linear programming; and NP-completeness.

## Progress:

### Dynamic programming
* Fibonacci 
* LIS 
* LCS
* Knapsack
* Chain Maintrix  Multiply
* Shortest path: **UNFINISHED!**


### Divide and conquer
* Faster Integer Multiplication
* Linear Time Median (Linear Time Selection)
